      "content": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the probability of drawing exactly 2 aces when I take 5 cards from a standard deck. Hmm, let me start by recalling some basics about probability and combinatorics. \n\nFirst, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards, with 4 aces and 48 non-ace cards. When we're dealing with probabilities involving combinations, especially when the order doesn't matter, combinations are the way to go. So, I think combinations will be key here.\n\nThe problem is about drawing exactly 2 aces out of 5 cards. So, I need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes (getting exactly 2 aces and 3 non-aces) divided by the total number of possible 5-card hands.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Total number of possible 5-card hands**: This is the combination of 52 cards taken 5 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where \"n\" is the total number, and \"k\" is the number we're choosing. So, C(52, 5) will give me the total number of possible hands.\n\n2. **Number of favorable outcomes (exactly 2 aces and 3 non-aces)**: This part is a bit more involved. I think I need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 aces from the 4 available and then multiply that by the number of ways to choose 3 non-aces from the 48 available. So, it would be C(4, 2) * C(48, 3).\n\n3. **Calculating each combination**:\n   - Let me compute C(4, 2) first. That's 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6.\n   - Next, C(48, 3). That's 48! / (3! * (48-3)!) = (48*47*46)/(3*2*1) = let me calculate that. 48*47 is 2256, times 46 is... wait, 2256*46. Let me do that step by step. 2256*40 is 90,240, and 2256*6 is 13,536. Adding those gives 90,240 + 13,536 = 103,776. Then divide by 6, which is 103,776 / 6. Let me see, 100,000 /6 is about 16,666.666, and 3,776 /6 is 629.333, so total is 17,296. So, C(48,3) is 17,296.\n\n4. **Total favorable outcomes**: So, 6 (from C(4,2)) multiplied by 17,296 (from C(48,3)) is 6*17,296. Let me compute that. 17,296 * 6: 17,000*6=102,000 and 296*6=1,776. So total is 102,000 + 1,776 = 103,776.\n\n5. **Total possible 5-card hands**: Now, C(52,5). Let me compute that. 52! / (5! * 47!) = (52*51*50*49*48)/(5*4*3*2*1). Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.\n\n   Numerator: 52*51=2,652; 2,652*50=132,600; 132,600*49=6,497,400; 6,497,400*48=311,059,200.\n\n   Denominator: 5*4=20; 20*3=60; 60*2=120; 120*1=120.\n\n   So, C(52,5) = 311,059,200 / 120. Let me do that division. 311,059,200 ÷ 120. Let me see, 311,059,200 ÷ 10 = 31,105,920. Then ÷12 = 2,592,660. Wait, no, wait, 120 is 10*12, so 311,059,200 ÷10=31,105,920, then ÷12. Let me compute 31,105,920 ÷12. 12*2,592,660=31,091,920. Hmm, that's 31,091,920, so 31,105,920 -31,091,920=14,000. So 14,000 ÷12=1,166.666. So total is 2,592,660 +1,166.666≈2,593,826.666. Wait, that can't be right because I know C(52,5) is 2,598,960. Wait, I must have made a mistake in my calculation.\n\n   Let me try again. 52*51*50*49*48. Let me compute step by step.\n\n   52*51=2,652.\n\n   2,652*50=132,600.\n\n   132,600*49: Let me compute 132,600*50=6,630,000, then subtract 132,600 to get 6,630,000 -132,600=6,497,400.\n\n   Then 6,497,400*48: Let me compute 6,497,400*40=259,896,000 and 6,497,400*8=51,979,200. Adding those gives 259,896,000 +51,979,200=311,875,200.\n\n   Now, denominator is 120, so 311,875,200 ÷120. Let me divide by 10 first: 31,187,520. Then divide by 12: 31,187,520 ÷12. 12*2,598,960=31,187,520. So, C(52,5)=2,598,960. Okay, that makes sense.\n\n6. **Calculating the probability**: So, the probability is (number of favorable outcomes) / (total number of possible hands) = 103,776 / 2,598,960.\n\n7. **Simplifying the fraction**: Let me see if I can reduce this fraction. Let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of numerator and denominator.\n\n   Let me compute GCD of 103,776 and 2,598,960.\n\n   Let me use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n   First, divide 2,598,960 by 103,776.\n\n   103,776 *25 = 2,594,400.\n\n   2,598,960 -2,594,400=4,560.\n\n   So, GCD(103,776,4,560).\n\n   Now, divide 103,776 by 4,560.\n\n   4,560*22=100,320.\n\n   103,776-100,320=3,456.\n\n   So, GCD(4,560,3,456).\n\n   Divide 4,560 by 3,456: 3,456*1=3,456. Remainder=1,104.\n\n   GCD(3,456,1,104).\n\n   3,456 ÷1,104=3*1,104=3,312. Remainder=144.\n\n   GCD(1,104,144).\n\n   1,104 ÷144=7*144=1,008. Remainder=96.\n\n   GCD(144,96).\n\n   144 ÷96=1*96=96. Remainder=48.\n\n   GCD(96,48)=48.\n\n   So, GCD is 48.\n\n   So, divide numerator and denominator by 48.\n\n   103,776 ÷48= let's see, 48*2,160=103,680. 103,776-103,680=96. So, 2,160 + 2=2,162.\n\n   2,598,960 ÷48: 48*54,145=2,598, 960. So, 54,145.\n\n   So, simplified fraction is 2,162 /54,145.\n\n   Wait, let me check that division again because 48*2,162=103,776, yes. And 48*54,145=2,598,960.\n\n   Now, let me check if 2,162 and 54,145 have any common factors.\n\n   Let me try dividing 2,162 by 2: 2,162 ÷2=1,081. So, 2,162=2*1,081.\n\n   Now, check if 1,081 divides into 54,145.\n\n   54,145 ÷1,081. Let me see, 1,081*50=54,050. 54,145-54,050=95. So, no, it's not divisible.\n\n   So, the simplified fraction is 2,162/54,145. Let me see if that reduces further. Let me check if 2,162 and 54,145 have any common factors.\n\n   2,162 is even, 54,145 is odd, so 2 is not a common factor.\n\n   Let me check if 2,162 is divisible by 3: 2+1+6+2=11, which is not divisible by 3"
