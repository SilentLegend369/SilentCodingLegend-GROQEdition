      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to solve the quadratic equation 3x² + 6x - 24 = 0. Let me think about how to approach this. Quadratic equations can be solved using several methods: factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. Let me see which one works here.\n\nFirst, maybe I should try factoring. To factor 3x² + 6x -24, I notice that all the coefficients (3, 6, -24) are divisible by 3. Maybe I can factor out a 3 first to simplify the equation. Let me try that:\n\n3x² + 6x -24 = 0  \nFactor out 3:  \n3(x² + 2x - 8) = 0\n\nNow the equation is 3 times (x² + 2x -8) equals zero. Since 3 isn't zero, the equation inside the parentheses must be zero. So I can rewrite it as:\n\nx² + 2x - 8 = 0\n\nHmm, now I need to factor x² + 2x -8. Let's see if there are two numbers that multiply to -8 and add up to 2. Let's list the pairs of factors of -8:\n\n-1 and 8 → -1 +8 =7 → no  \n1 and -8 →1 + (-8)= -7 → no  \n-2 and 4 →-2 +4=2 → yes! \n\nWait, -2 and 4 multiply to -8 (because -2 *4 = -8) and add up to 2. Perfect. So that means the quadratic factors as:\n\n(x - 2)(x +4) =0\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's expand (x -2)(x +4):\n\nx*x =x²  \nx*4=4x  \n-2*x= -2x  \n-2*4= -8  \nSo combining terms: x² +4x -2x -8 = x² +2x -8. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo now the equation is (x -2)(x +4)=0. \n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:\n\nx -2 =0 → x=2  \nx +4 =0 →x= -4\n\nWait, so the solutions are x=2 and x=-4. But let me verify this by plugging them back into the original equation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, plug in x=2:\n\n3*(2)^2 +6*(2) -24 = 3*4 +12 -24 =12 +12 -24 =24 -24=0. That works.\n\nNow x=-4:\n\n3*(-4)^2 +6*(-4) -24 =3*16 + (-24) -24 =48 -24 -24 =0. That also works.\n\nHmm, so that seems correct. But wait, let me double-check my factoring step again. I had the original equation 3x² +6x -24 =0, factored out 3 to get x² +2x -8, which factors into (x-2)(x+4). Then solutions x=2 and x=-4. That all checks out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should also try using the quadratic formula to confirm. The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± √(b²-4ac)]/(2a). Let me apply that to the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x² +6x -24=0. Here, a=3, b=6, c=-24.\n\nDiscriminant D = b² -4ac = (6)^2 -4*3*(-24) =36 -4*3*(-24). Wait, 4*3 is 12, and 12*(-24)= -288. So 36 - (-288)= 36 +288= 324. \n\nSquare root of 324 is 18. \n\nThen x = [-6 ±18]/(2*3) → two solutions:\n\nFirst solution: (-6 +18)/6 =12/6=2  \nSecond solution: (-6 -18)/6= (-24)/6= -4. \n\nSame answers as before. So that confirms it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there was any step where I could have made an error. Let's see. When I factored out the 3 initially, that was correct. The factoring of x² +2x -8 into (x-2)(x+4) was right. And the quadratic formula gives the same results. \n\nTherefore, the solutions are x=2 and x=-4. \n\nI think that's all. The key steps were factoring out the GCF first, then factoring the quadratic, and verifying with the quadratic formula. I also checked both solutions in the original equation to confirm they work. Seems solid.\n</think>\n\nThe solutions to the equation \\(3x^2 + 6x - 24 = 0\\) are found as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF).**  \nThe equation can be simplified by factoring out a 3:  \n\\[\n3(x^2 + 2x - 8) = 0\n\\]  \nThis reduces the problem to solving \\(x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0\\).\n\n**Step 2: Factor the quadratic equation.**  \nFind two numbers that multiply to \\(-8\\) and add to \\(2\\). The numbers \\(-2\\) and \\(4\\) satisfy this:  \n\\[\n(x - 2)(x + 4) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\(x\\) using the zero product property.**  \nSet each factor equal to zero:  \n\\[\nx - 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 2  \n\\]  \n\\[\nx + 4 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -4  \n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Verify using the quadratic formula (optional but recommended).**  \nFor \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the solutions are:  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]  \nPlugging in \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 6\\), \\(c = -24\\):  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{6^2 - 4(3)(-24)}}{2(3)} = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{324}}{6} = \\frac{-6 \\pm 18}{6}\n\\]  \nThis gives:  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{12}{6} = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-24}{6} = -4\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe solutions are \\(\\boxed{2}\\) and \\(\\boxed{-4}\\)."
