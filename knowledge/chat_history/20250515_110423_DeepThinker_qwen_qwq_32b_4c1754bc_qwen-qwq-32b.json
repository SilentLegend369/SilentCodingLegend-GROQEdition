      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to solve the quadratic equation 3x² + 6x - 24 = 0. Let me think about how to approach this. Quadratic equations can be solved using several methods: factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. Let me see which one works here.\n\nFirst, maybe I should try factoring. To factor 3x² + 6x -24, I notice that all the coefficients (3, 6, -24) are divisible by 3. Maybe I can factor out a 3 first to simplify the equation. Let me try that:\n\n3x² + 6x -24 = 0  \nFactor out 3:  \n3(x² + 2x - 8) = 0\n\nNow the equation is 3 times (x² + 2x -8) equals zero. Since 3 isn't zero, the equation inside the parentheses must be zero. So I can rewrite it as:\n\nx² + 2x - 8 = 0\n\nHmm, now I need to factor x² + 2x -8. Let's see if there are two numbers that multiply to -8 and add up to 2. Let's list the pairs of factors of -8:\n\n-1 and 8 → -1 +8 =7 → no  \n1 and -8 →1 + (-8)= -7 → no  \n-2 and 4 →-2 +4=2 → yes! \n\nWait, -2 and 4 multiply to -8 (because -2 *4 = -8) and add up to 2. Perfect. So that means the quadratic factors as:\n\n(x - 2)(x +4) =0\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's expand (x -2)(x +4):\n\nx*x =x²  \nx*4=4x  \n-2*x= -2x  \n-2*4= -8  \nSo combining terms: x² +4x -2x -8 = x² +2x -8. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo now the equation is (x -2)(x +4)=0. \n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:\n\nx -2 =0 → x=2  \nx +4 =0 →x= -4\n\nWait, so the solutions are x=2 and x=-4. But let me verify this by plugging them back into the original equation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, plug in x=2:\n\n3*(2)^2 +6*(2) -24 = 3*4 +12 -24 =12 +12 -24 =24 -24=0. That works.\n\nNow x=-4:\n\n3*(-4)^2 +6*(-4) -24 =3*16 + (-24) -24 =48 -24 -24 =0. That also works.\n\nHmm, so that seems correct. But wait, let me double-check my factoring step again. I had the original equation 3x² +6x -24 =0, factored out 3 to get x² +2x -8, which factors into (x-2)(x+4). Then solutions x=2 and x=-4. That all checks out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should also try using the quadratic formula to confirm. The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± √(b²-4ac)]/(2a). Let me apply that to the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x² +6x -24=0. Here, a=3, b=6, c=-24.\n\nDiscriminant D = b² -4ac = (6)^2 -4*3*(-24) =36 -4*3*(-24). Wait, 4*3 is 12, and 12*(-24)= -288. So 36 - (-288)= 36 +288= 324. \n\nSquare root of 324 is 18. \n\nThen x = [-6 ±18]/(2*3) → two solutions:\n\nFirst solution: (-6 +18)/6 =12/6=2  \nSecond solution: (-6 -18)/6= (-24)/6= -4. \n\nSame answers as before. So that confirms it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there was any step where I could have made an error. Let's see. When I factored out the 3 initially, that was correct. The factoring of x² +2x -8 into (x-2)(x+4) was right. And the quadratic formula gives the same results. \n\nTherefore, the solutions are x=2 and x=-4. \n\nI think that's all. The key steps were factoring out the GCF first, then factoring the quadratic, and verifying with the quadratic formula. I also checked both solutions in the original equation to confirm they work. Seems solid.\n</think>\n\nThe solutions to the equation \\(3x^2 + 6x - 24 = 0\\) are found as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF).**  \nThe equation can be simplified by factoring out a 3:  \n\\[\n3(x^2 + 2x - 8) = 0\n\\]  \nThis reduces the problem to solving \\(x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0\\).\n\n**Step 2: Factor the quadratic equation.**  \nFind two numbers that multiply to \\(-8\\) and add to \\(2\\). The numbers \\(-2\\) and \\(4\\) satisfy this:  \n\\[\n(x - 2)(x + 4) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\(x\\) using the zero product property.**  \nSet each factor equal to zero:  \n\\[\nx - 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 2  \n\\]  \n\\[\nx + 4 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -4  \n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Verify using the quadratic formula (optional but recommended).**  \nFor \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the solutions are:  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]  \nPlugging in \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 6\\), \\(c = -24\\):  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{6^2 - 4(3)(-24)}}{2(3)} = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{324}}{6} = \\frac{-6 \\pm 18}{6}\n\\]  \nThis gives:  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{12}{6} = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-24}{6} = -4\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe solutions are \\(\\boxed{2}\\) and \\(\\boxed{-4}\\)."

      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm a delivery driver in Lake Dallas, TX, and I have two orders to deliver. The goal is to maximize the number of deliveries before the store closes at 10 PM. The current time is 7:30 PM, so I have 2.5 hours, which is 150 minutes, to get both pizzas delivered and return to the shop. The challenge here is that I can only carry one pizza at a time, so I have to make two separate trips. I need to figure out the best route to minimize the total time so I can return before 10 PM. \n\nFirst, I need to know the driving times between the different locations. The problem mentions I have a map, so I should probably consider the driving times between the pizza shop (789 Elm St), Order A (123 Main St), and Order B (456 Oak Ave). But the problem doesn't give exact driving times. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I need to make an assumption here or realize there's missing information. Since the problem states I have a map, perhaps I'm supposed to figure out the possible routes based on standard driving times or maybe there's a standard setup for such problems? Alternatively, maybe the key is to realize that without specific driving times, the optimal strategy would depend on which order can be delivered faster, allowing me to do both in time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to use a common-sense approach where I need to determine the shortest path. Wait, but without knowing the distances between the locations, how can I calculate? Maybe the problem expects me to realize that since I can only carry one pizza at a time, the key is to choose the order that takes less time first so that I can do the second one and return in time. But without the driving times, perhaps there's another angle. Wait, maybe the store is the starting point, so I have to go from the shop to one location, drop off the pizza, come back to the shop, then go to the second location, then return to the shop? Or maybe can I go to one location, then directly to the other, saving time?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is designed so that regardless of the order, the time required for two trips with a return to the shop each time would exceed the available time, unless there's an optimal sequence. Alternatively, maybe the store allows me to leave the pizzas at the second location without returning to the shop in between. Wait no, the problem says I can only carry one pizza at a time, so I have to make two trips. Each trip would involve going from the shop to the first address, delivering, then returning to the shop to pick up the second pizza, then going to the second address, then back to the shop. Wait, no—if I can go from the first delivery to the second without returning to the shop, that would save time. Let me clarify the process.\n\nThe standard delivery process would be: Start at the shop. Take order A, drive to address A, deliver, then return to shop to pick up order B, drive to address B, deliver, then return to shop. That would take time equal to (time from shop to A + time from A to shop) + (time from shop to B + time from B to shop). Alternatively, maybe I can go from A to B directly after delivering A, then back to shop. Let me think: \n\nOption 1: \nShop -> A -> Shop -> B -> Shop. \n\nTotal time is (Shop to A + A to Shop) + (Shop to B + B to Shop). \n\nOption 2: \nShop -> A -> B -> Shop. \n\nThis would be Shop to A, then A to B, then B to Shop. \n\nOption 2 might be shorter if the distance from A to B is less than going back to the shop and then to B. But since I can only carry one pizza at a time, after delivering A, I can go directly to B without returning to the shop, right? Wait, no, because I need to pick up the second pizza from the shop. Wait a second, when I leave the shop, I can only carry one pizza. So if I go to A first, deliver it, then I have to go back to the shop to pick up the second pizza (B), then go to B's address. Alternatively, is there a way to go from A to B without returning to the shop? Probably not, because the second pizza is still at the shop. Therefore, after delivering A, I have to return to the shop to pick up B. So the route is Shop -> A -> Shop -> B -> Shop. That's the only way if I have to carry each pizza separately. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can carry both pizzas but that's not allowed here because the problem states I can only carry one at a time. Therefore, I have to make two one-way trips with a return to the shop each time. \n\nWait, actually, perhaps there's a different route where after delivering order A, instead of going back to the shop immediately, I go directly to B's address, but to do that, I would have to have the second pizza, which I don't have unless I went back to the shop. So, no, I need to return to the shop between the two deliveries. \n\nTherefore, the total time required is:\n\nTime for first trip (Shop to A, then back to Shop) + Time for second trip (Shop to B, then back to Shop). But wait, actually, the second trip would be Shop to B, deliver, then back to shop. Wait no, actually, the order would be: \n\nFirst delivery: \n\n1. Start at Shop, pick up order A, drive to A, deliver, then return to Shop. \n\nSecond delivery: \n\n2. Then, pick up order B, drive to B, deliver, return to Shop. \n\nWait, but the problem says I can only carry one pizza at a time. The total time would be the time to go Shop to A and back, plus the time to go Shop to B and back. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to optimize by choosing the order of deliveries to minimize the total time. \n\nAlternatively, if I go from Shop to A, deliver, then go directly to B without returning to the shop, but I can't do that unless I have both pizzas, which I can't. Therefore, I have to go back to the shop after delivering A to get B. \n\nTherefore, the total driving time is (time Shop to A + time A to Shop) + (time Shop to B + time B to Shop). \n\nAlternatively, if I reverse the order, going to B first: \n\n(total time would be (Shop to B + B to Shop) + (Shop to A + A to Shop). \n\nThe total time depends on which order (A then B or B then A) is shorter. \n\nTherefore, to minimize total time, I need to choose the order where the sum of the round trips is minimized. \n\nBut since the problem doesn't give specific driving times between the locations, perhaps I need to consider that maybe the driving time between the two addresses is shorter than going back to the shop. Wait, but in the absence of specific data, maybe the optimal strategy is to minimize the total time by choosing which order to do first based on which has shorter round trip. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another approach. Let's think of possible variables. Let me denote the driving times as variables to see:\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nLet’s define:\n\n- Time from Shop to A as t1 (minutes)\n- Time from Shop to B as t2 (minutes)\n- Time from A to B as t3 (minutes)\n- Time from B to A as t4 (minutes, which would be same as t3 if the roads are symmetric)\n\nBut since the problem doesn't provide specific numbers, maybe the problem is expecting an answer that works regardless of the distances, or perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem expects me to realize that regardless of the route, if the total time required is under 150 minutes, then both can be done, but if not, then I have to choose which one to prioritize. Wait but the question says \"maximize the number of orders delivered\". So maybe the key is to ensure that both can be delivered before 10 PM, so I need to choose the order that allows me to do both within 150 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem implies that the total time required for both deliveries is less than or equal to 150 minutes, so the answer is to do both, but to choose the order that minimizes the total time, thereby ensuring that there's enough time. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an optimal path where after delivering one pizza, I can go directly to the other address and then back, avoiding returning to the shop between deliveries. Wait, but that's not possible because the second pizza is still at the shop. Unless I can pick up the second pizza after delivering the first, but that requires going back to the shop first. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to think of an example. Let's suppose hypothetical times. Let's say the problem expects me to think through the steps even without exact numbers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that to maximize the number of deliveries, I have to make sure that the total time for both deliveries plus returning to the shop is under 150 minutes. Therefore, the strategy is to choose the order of deliveries such that the total time is minimized. To do that, the driver should choose the order where the sum of the distances (or driving times) is minimized. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that if the time to deliver both is possible within the time"

      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to know how many combinations can be formed using the numbers 3, 6, 9, and 7, while keeping the same amount of digits and the same count of each number, especially ensuring that the number of 7s remains the same. Wait, actually, the problem says \"keeping the same amount of digits, '7' and keeping the same numbers, '3-6-9-7'\". Hmm, maybe I need to parse that again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"keeping the same amount of digits, '7' and keeping the same numbers, '3-6-9-7'\". Maybe it's a translation issue. Let me read it again: \"How many combinations are possible using the following numbers but keeping the same amount of digits, '7' and keeping the same numbers, '3-6-9-7'\". \n\nHmm, perhaps the user means that the combinations must use the digits 3,6,9,7, and the count of each digit (except maybe 7?) must remain the same. Wait, maybe the problem is similar to a permutation with some constraints. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original question is: given a number composed of digits 3,6,9, and 7, how many different combinations can be formed if we must use the same number of each digit except perhaps for the 7? Or maybe keeping the same count of 7 as in the original number? Wait, but the user provided the number 3697963 at the start. Wait, looking back, the user's message starts with \"3697963\" and then the question. Oh, maybe that number is an example? Let me check.\n\nWait, the user's message starts with \"3697963\" followed by a line break and then the question. So perhaps \"3697963\" is the original number, and the question is to find how many combinations can be formed using the same digits (3,6,9,7) but keeping the same count of each digit? Or maybe the same count of 7s, while possibly varying others? Let me see.\n\nLooking at the original number 3697963: Let me count each digit in it. Let's break it down:\n\nDigits in 3697963:\n\n- 3: Let's count. The number is 3,6,9,7,9,6,3. So positions 0-6:\n\nPositions:\n0:3\n1:6\n2:9\n3:7\n4:9\n5:6\n6:3\n\nSo digits: 3 appears twice (positions 0 and 6), 6 appears twice (positions 1 and 5), 9 appears twice (positions 2 and 4), and 7 appears once (position 3). So total digits: 7.\n\nThe question is asking for the number of combinations possible using the same digits (so same count for each digit?) but keeping the same amount of digits and the same numbers 3,6,9,7. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for permutations of the original number's digits, considering that each digit's count must remain the same?\n\nWait, that's probably it. Because if you have a number like 3697963, which has specific counts for each digit (2 3s, 2 6s, 2 9s, 1 7), then the number of unique permutations would be the multinomial coefficient: total digits factorial divided by the product of factorials of counts of each digit.\n\nWait, but maybe that's exactly what they want. Let me confirm.\n\nThe problem says \"combinations possible using the following numbers but keeping the same amount of digits, '7' and keeping the same numbers, '3-6-9-7'\". Hmm, maybe the wording is a bit unclear. But given that the original number is 3697963, which has specific counts, I think the question is asking for the number of unique permutations of that original number, which would account for repeated digits. So, the formula would be 7! divided by (number of each digit's factorial), since permutations of identical items are indistinct.\n\nWait, let me verify each digit's count again in 3697963:\n\n- 3: appears 2 times (positions 0 and 6)\n- 6: appears 2 times (positions 1 and 5)\n- 9: appears 2 times (positions 2 and 4)\n- 7: appears 1 time (position 3)\n\nSo total digits: 7.\n\nTherefore, the number of unique permutations would be 7! divided by (2! for 3s, 2! for 6s, 2! for 9s, and 1! for 7). Since 1! is 1, it doesn't affect the denominator. So the calculation would be:\n\n7! / (2! * 2! * 2! * 1!) = 5040 / (2*2*2) = 5040 / 8 = 630.\n\nBut let me check if that's the correct interpretation. The problem says \"keeping the same amount of digits, '7' and keeping the same numbers, '3-6-9-7'\". The \"same amount of digits, '7'\" might mean that the count of 7 must stay the same (i.e., exactly one 7), and the other numbers 3,6,9 must also be present with the same counts as in the original number. Because otherwise, if you could vary the counts, the problem would be different. So if we have to use exactly two 3s, two 6s, two 9s, and one 7, then the total permutations would indeed be 7! divided by (2!2!2!1!) which is 5040/(8) = 630. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is interpreted differently. For instance, if the original number is 3697963 (7 digits), and we need to form numbers using exactly those digits (so same count for each digit except maybe 7?), but the wording is confusing. Wait the user wrote \"keeping the same amount of digits, '7' and keeping the same numbers, '3-6-9-7'\". Hmm, maybe \"same amount of digits, '7'\" means the same number of 7s as in the original. The original has one 7, so the combinations must also have exactly one 7, and the other numbers (3,6,9) should be used with the same counts as in the original? That would make sense. Because otherwise, if they can vary the counts, it's a different problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"keeping the same amount of digits, '7'\" could mean keeping the same total number of digits (7 digits) and keeping the same digits (only using 3,6,9,7), but the count of each digit can vary as long as the total digits are 7. But that might not make sense because the problem mentions \"keeping the same numbers, '3-6-9-7'\". Maybe \"same numbers\" here means using exactly those numbers, so digits can only be 3,6,9,7, but how many of each? The original number has 2,2,2,1. But if we have to keep the same count for each digit, then it's permutations. But if they can vary, but must use those digits, but the problem is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to form 7-digit numbers using the digits 3,6,9,7, with exactly one 7 and the rest being 3,6,9, but with the counts of 3,6,9 being any, but the problem mentions \"keeping the same numbers, 3-6-9-7\". Hmm, maybe the user wants permutations of the original number's digits, which would be the multinomial approach I thought earlier. Let me look again.\n\nThe problem is stated as: \"How many combinations are possible using the following numbers but keeping the same amount of digits, '7' and keeping the same numbers, '3-6-9-7'\". The key points here: \"using the following numbers\" — perhaps referring to the digits 3,6,9,7 — \"keeping the same amount of digits, '7'\" — meaning the count of 7 must stay the same as in the original number, which is 1. And \"keeping the same numbers, 3-6-9-7\" — probably meaning that exactly those digits must be used, so you can't introduce new digits. Therefore, the counts for the other digits (3,6,9) must also be the same as the original? Because otherwise, if you can vary their counts, then the problem would need more info.\n\nTherefore, the problem is likely asking for the number of unique permutations of the original number's digits, which would be the multinomial coefficient as above. Since the original number has 2 3s, 2 6s, 2 9s, and 1 7, the formula is indeed 7! divided by (2!2!2!1!) which is 5040 / (2*2*2) = 630. \n\nBut let me check again if there's another interpretation. Alternatively, if \"keeping the same amount of digits, '7'\" is interpreted as keeping the"
